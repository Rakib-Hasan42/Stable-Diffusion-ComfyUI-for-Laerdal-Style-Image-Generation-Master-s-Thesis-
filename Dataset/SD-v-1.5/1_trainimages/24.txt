Laerdalstyle, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of an elderly bald man with a gray beard, sitting in a wheelchair. He is wearing a short-sleeved, light blue striped shirt and black shoes, while a teal blanket covers his legs. His hands are resting on his lap, and he has a relaxed posture. The wheelchair has a metallic gray frame, black seat and armrests, and large rear wheels with a silver rim and black tires. The illustration follows a flat design style, set against a plain white background.
