Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of a healthcare professional standing upright with both gloved hands raised. The individual is dressed in teal scrubs with white trim on the pockets and neckline, wearing blue-purple gloves and white shoes. The figureâ€™s clean lines and professional posture align with the modern, instructional aesthetic often used in medical training visuals.
