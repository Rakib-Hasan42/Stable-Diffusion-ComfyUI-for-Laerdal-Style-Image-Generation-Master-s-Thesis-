Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of a woman standing with a welcoming gesture. She has light blonde hair tied in a ponytail with a blue hair tie, and she wears a green half-sleeve top, teal-blue pants, and turquoise shoes. One arm is extended outward with the palm facing up, as if presenting or explaining something, while the other hand is lightly touching her side.
