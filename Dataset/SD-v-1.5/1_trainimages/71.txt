Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of a CPR training scenario involving three people. A woman with dark hair in a bun and a man with light brown hair are kneeling on the floor, practicing CPR on a manikin. The man places AED pads while the woman performs chest compressions. A third person with long black hair stands nearby wearing a mint green jacket and blue pants, observing and holding a black tablet with signal waves indicating active monitoring. The scene includes flat design, clean lines, pastel color palette, and a white background.
