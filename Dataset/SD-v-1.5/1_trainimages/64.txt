Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of two healthcare professionals using an AED on an unconscious patient. A female in mint green scrubs and cap is performing chest compressions, while a male in similar mint attire operates a blue defibrillator with electrode pads attached to the patient's chest. The patient lies flat with light skin and blonde hair, and the AED screen displays pad placement instructions. Clean flat design, soft pastel color palette, and plain white background.
