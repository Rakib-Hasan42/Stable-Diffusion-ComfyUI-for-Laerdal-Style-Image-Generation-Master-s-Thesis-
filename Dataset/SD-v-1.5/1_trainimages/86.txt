Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of a man on his hands and knees. He has short red hair and is wearing a light green shirt, blue pants, and dark green shoes with light gray soles. The illustration uses clean vector lines and soft, flat colors on a white background, capturing a posture that may suggest searching, inspecting, or assisting.
