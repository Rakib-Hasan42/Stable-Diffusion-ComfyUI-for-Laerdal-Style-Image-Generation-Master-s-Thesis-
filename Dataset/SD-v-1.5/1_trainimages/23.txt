Laerdalstyle, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of an elderly man wearing a dark gray fedora hat, black-framed glasses, a black formal suit with a white shirt, dark gray pants, and black shoes. He is slightly hunched over, using a brown walking cane for support, with one hand gripping the cane and the other tucked into his jacket pocket. The illustration follows a flat design style, with no visible facial features except for the glasses, set against a plain white background.
