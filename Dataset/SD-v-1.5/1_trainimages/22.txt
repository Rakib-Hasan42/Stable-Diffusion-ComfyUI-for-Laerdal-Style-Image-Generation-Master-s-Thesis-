Laerdalstyle, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of an elderly man with a partially bald head, gray hair on the sides, a beard, and a mustache. He is wearing a brown long-sleeved jacket, a white shirt, beige pants, a gray belt, and brown shoes. He is slightly leaning forward while using a teal walking cane for support. The illustration follows a flat design style, with no visible facial features except for the beard, set against a plain white background.
