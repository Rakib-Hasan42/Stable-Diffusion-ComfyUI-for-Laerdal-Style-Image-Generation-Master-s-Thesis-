Laerdal-style, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration showing a CPR training scenario with two individuals working on a manikin. A man with light brown hair kneels on the left side, using a manual resuscitator (bag-valve-mask) to provide ventilation. A woman with dark hair in a bun kneels on the right, performing chest compressions. The manikin lies on a training mat with a blanket partially covering the lower half. The illustration features clean lines, soft pastel colors including shades of blue, peach, and gray, and a plain white background in a flat design style.
