Laerdalstyle, faceless, minimalistic vector illustration of a man with short black hair, a beard, and a mustache, wearing a brown short-sleeved shirt, blue pants, and brown shoes. He is adjusting a large professional video camera mounted on a sturdy tripod stand, using one hand to hold the camera and the other to turn an adjustment knob. The camera features a lens, viewfinder, and barn doors for controlling light. The illustration follows a flat design style, with no visible facial features except for the beard, set against a plain white background
